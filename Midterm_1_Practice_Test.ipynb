    "Consider an investor who allocates funds into three different types of stocks: tech, healthcare, and energy. The investor selects a single stock to invest in each day, randomly choosing from a pool consisting of 5 tech, 8 healthcare, and 4 energy stocks. The daily return on investment (ROI) for selecting a tech stock is 5%, for a healthcare stock is 8%, and for an energy stock is 12%.\n",

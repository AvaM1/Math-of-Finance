    "### Introduction to Options and Put-Call Parity\n",
    "\n",
    "#### European Options\n",
    "\n",
    "Options are financial derivatives that give buyers the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price, known as the strike price, before a specified expiration date.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### European Call and Put Options\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Call Option**: Gives the holder the right to buy the underlying asset at the strike price.\n",
    "- **Put Option**: Gives the holder the right to sell the underlying asset at the strike price.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Long and Short Positions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Long Position (Buying an Option)**: The buyer of the option holds a long position. They have the right to exercise the option.\n",
    "- **Short Position (Selling/Writing an Option)**: The seller or writer of the option holds a short position. They have the obligation to fulfill the contract if the buyer exercises the option.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Profit Equations for European Options\n",
    "\n",
    "The profit for options can be calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Call Option Profit**: \n",
    "  $$\\text{Profit} = \\max(S_T - K, 0) - \\text{Premium}$$\n",
    "  Where $S_T$ is the spot price of the underlying asset at expiration, $K$ is the strike price, and $\\text{Premium}$ is the price paid for the option.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Put Option Profit**:\n",
    "  $$\\text{Profit} = \\max(K - S_T, 0) - \\text{Premium}$$\n",
    "  Where $S_T$ is the spot price of the underlying asset at expiration, $K$ is the strike price, and $\\text{Premium}$ is the price paid for the option.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Put-Call Parity\n",
    "\n",
    "The put-call parity is a principle in options pricing that describes the relationship between the prices of European call and put options with the same underlying asset, strike price, and expiration date.\n",
    "\n",
    "The put-call parity equation is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$C + Ke^{-r(T-t)} = P + S_t$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $C$ is the price of the European call option\n",
    "- $P$ is the price of the European put option\n",
    "- $K$ is the strike price\n",
    "- $r$ is the risk-free interest rate\n",
    "- $T-t$ is the time to expiration\n",
    "- $S_t$ is the current spot price of the underlying asset\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation demonstrates that the value of a portfolio consisting of a long call and a short put with the same strike price and expiration date should be equal to the value of a portfolio consisting of the underlying asset and a risk-free bond with a face value equal to the strike price.\n",

    "### Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Microsoft Corporation (ticker: MSFT) has a market capitalization of $1.9 trillion, and its stock is currently trading at $250. Consider a portfolio of MSFT stock options that consists of the following components, all with six months until expiration:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Long 10 call option with a strike price of $220\n",
    "- Short 10 put option with a strike price of $220\n",
    "- Short 10 call option with a strike price of $280\n",
    "- Long 10 put option with a strike price of $280\n",

    "#### Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem, we can use the put-call parity equation for each pair of options with the same strike price. The put-call parity equation states that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$C + Ke^{-r(T-t)} = P + S_t$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first pair of options with a strike price of $220, let:\n",
    "- $C_{220}$ be the price of the call option with strike price $220\n",
    "- $P_{220}$ be the price of the put option with strike price $220\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, for the second pair of options with a strike price of $280, let:\n",
    "- $C_{280}$ be the price of the call option with strike price $280\n",
    "- $P_{280}$ be the price of the put option with strike price $280\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying the put-call parity equation to each pair of options:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$C_{220} + 220e^{-0.02 \\times 0.5} = P_{220} + 250$$\n",
    "$$C_{280} + 280e^{-0.02 \\times 0.5} = P_{280} + 250$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of the options portfolio is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$10V =10( C_{220} - P_{220} - C_{280} + P_{280})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Substituting the put-call parity equations into the portfolio value equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V = (P_{220} + 250 - 220e^{-0.02 \\times 0.5}) - P_{220} - (P_{280} + 250 - 280e^{-0.02 \\times 0.5}) + P_{280}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplifying the equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V = 280e^{-0.02 \\times 0.5} - 220e^{-0.02 \\times 0.5} = 60e^{-0.02 \\times 0.5}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculating the numerical value:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$10*V = 10*60e^{-0.02 \\times 0.5} \\approx 594$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the value of the options portfolio today is approximately $594."
